whatsapp-desktop-client
=======================

Whatsapp is a chatting application for mobile phones. Anyone with a modern smart phone can download the Whatsapp application and start chatting with other people who have the Whatsapp application installed. At this moment Whatsapp is only available for mobile phone operating systems such as iOS and Android. The goal of this project is to create a working Whatsapp client for the desktop computer. 

Our goals

The goal is to create a stable and working Whatsapp desktop client and provide all those people with a great chatting application which can be used on both your smartphone and you desktop computer.
What has been done already?

We just started a few hours ago so don't expect to much already. There's still a lot of work to be done before we have a fully working client. So far we have setup the project and added some code to test authentication. This can be seen in the screenshot above this text. Our problem isn't only to code the client, the second problem is deciphering how Whatsapp works. We keep extended documentation on anything we find. You can read this documentation on the 'Wiki' tab of this site. We update it along our way.
Documentation?

To prevent the project from becoming a mess, you are obliged as a member of the development team to keep extended documentation of the code and your work. If you are a developer you should know how to add in-document documentation. We use a program called 'Doxygen' which generates a complete documentation based on comments in the code. You can find the latest version of the documentation here:

Language

We use C# as our primary programming language. In the beginning we were about to choose C++ as our primary language. We were also thinking about making something cross-platform. The problem was that Java is to insecure, C# can be cross-compiled using the Mono framework, but it's far from perfect. Writing in C++ would be a pain in the ass to make sure it's Operating System independent. After some debating we came to the conclusion that C# would be the best choice. We decided to drop the cross-platform idea and focus on create something working. C# is fast and easy to code, a programmer can produce more and better code in C# in less time then in C++. This is why our primary programming language is C#. We use Microsoft Visual Studio as our IDE and our applications are written using the .NET Framework 4.0.
